        <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as " Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters. He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King, which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to his brothers and crew. He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army, and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, and their family carries the initial and Will of D. Luffy met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday after he became a great pirate. Growing up on Dawn Island, Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, as well as being raised under the care of Curly Dadan.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into rubber. Thanks to his strong imagination, Luffy is able to wield the seemingly unthreatening abilities of his Devil Fruit to act an incredibly competent fighter, often manipulating his own rubbery body into a variety of powerful forms. He is one of few individuals known to have awakened his Devil Fruit, which bestows him with mythical power. In addition to his Devil Fruit abilities, Luffy is one of few individuals capable of wielding all three forms of Haki and has mastered them to the point that he has developed advanced abilities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea", though many prominent figures initially considered this to be exaggerated. However, after defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima, Luffy was officially declared as one of the Four Emperors by the World Government along with Buggy, replacing Kaidou and Big Mom.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Luffy has made tremendous strides in his life of piracy, with his bounty heavily reflecting this fact. He gained his first bounty of Beli 30,000,000 for defeating the strongest pirate captains of the East Blue, which then increased to Beli 100,000,000 after defeating Crocodile in Alabasta. After his crew's invasion into and escape from Enies Lobby, his bounty was increased to Beli.png300,000,000. His sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Luffy to be included among the eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beli 100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War.  He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation".</p>
        <br>
        <p>Two years after the war, with his bounty increased to Beli 400,000,000, he entered the New World and began challenging the Emperors and their allies directly, with his bounty going up to Beli 500,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, and later all the way to Beli 1,500,000,000 after the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc. Eventually, his conquests and his reputation end up contributing to his current bounty of Beli 3,000,000,000.</p>
